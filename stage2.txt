1. Search internet and other media, find relevant data sources that can be used in your experiment
    We found this article that scratches the surface of the subject:

    We found a source of data on cryptocurrencies here: 
    https://coinmetrics.io/community-network-data/
    (DogeCoin, Etherium, Bitcoin downloaded in data folder)

    We found a source of data for the US dollar index here: 
    https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/index/DXY/historical-prices
    (data is in data folder)

2. Integrate the sources in a shared repository by either ETL or ELT process
    We've chosen to use ELT (Extract, Load, Transform). The reason for this is, 
    that we have relatively neat data in CSV format extracted from the websites.
