# Big Project - Data Science Exam
This project is designed as applied research and experimental development of a data science implementation solution. The project activities involve systematic and creative work of finding novel, uncertain and reproduceable results by applying the modern data science technologies, experienced in class, in a business context.

# Roadmap
## Stage 1
The solution to this stage can be found in the `stage1.txt` file.
## Stage 2
The solution to this stage can be found in the `stage2.txt` file, the data we've collected can be found in the `data` folder and our pre processing (cleaning) and first visualizations of the data can be found in the python notebook in the `pre_processing` folder. The file is named `elt.ipynb`. 
## Stage 3
The solution to this stage can be found in the `stage3.txt` file. 

## Stage 4
The solution to this stage can be found in the `stage4.txt` file. 

## Focus of interest
Predictions of cryptocurrency values.

## Why do we find this interesting?
This topic is interesting in perticular, because cryptocurrency has been a "hot topic" since Bitcoin had a major increase in value back in 2016-2017. Cryptocurrencies was partly made popular by Elon Musk who is a big advocate for this type of currency.
We find the topic interesting due to the fact that it looks relatively unpredictable, and if we are able (with a relatively small margin of error) to predict it's future value, we will be able to make a lot of money off of this reseach. Either by using the prediction ourselves or sell access to our predictions.

## Which outcome do we expect from the research?
We expect to find that we are able to predict it's value in the near future. But that the margin of error will be too big for far future predictions. 

## Who can use the results from this research?
People who invest or plan to invest in cryptocurrencies, can use the results of this research.
We also expect that other people can use it as a base for their cryptocurrency research in the future. Saving them a lot of steps towards their results.
