    "#### 2. Why is it interesting?\n",
    "This topic is interesting in perticular, because cryptocurrency has been a \"hot topic\" since Bitcoin had a major increase in value back in 2016-2017. Cryptocurrencies was partly made popular by Elon Musk who is a big advocate for this type of currency.\n",
    "We find the topic interesting due to the fact that it looks relatively unpredictable, and if we are able (with a relatively small margin of error) to predict it's future value, we will be able to make a lot of money off of this reseach. Either by using the prediction ourselves or sell access to our predictions.\n",

    "We expect to find that we are able to predict it's value in the near future. But that the margin of error will be too big for far future predictions.\n",

    "#### 4. who may be a user of the results? \n",
    "People who invest or plan to invest in cryptocurrencies, can use the results of this research.\n",
    "We also expect that other people can use it as a base for their cryptocurrency research in the future. Saving them a lot of steps towards their results. \n",
