1. We have chosen to go with a RNN (Recurring Neural Network). 
    We will setup two different setups to see which will get the best result
    One will be Tensorflow with LSTM  (Long short term memory) ML using Tensorflow
    Another witch only Dense layers
    And then again using a different setup of LSTM
